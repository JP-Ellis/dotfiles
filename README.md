# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. I use [dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter) to manage them. Dotter features a simple TOML-based configuration file to map dotfiles to their respective locations. Simple files are symlinked, while more complex files can be templated using [handlebars](https://docs.rs/handlebars/latest/handlebars/).
