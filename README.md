# Dotfiles

Here's my collection of dotfiles.  They contain various configurations which I
use the most, including my [spacemacs][spacemacs] and [prezto][prezto]
configurations.

To use this configuration, run

```
git clone https://github.com/JP-Ellis/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.dotfiles"
~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
```

The setup script will prompt you to replace any existing configuration if they
exist (and make a backup of them in the process).
